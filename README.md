# NodeJsConfusion

This is a project based on a course in Coursera 'Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB' by Jogesh.K.Muppala

It is a backend project for a restaurent Website using Express.js in the Node.Js environement.  
I used passport.js for password authentication and used OAuth2.0 for third-party authentication with Facebook.
